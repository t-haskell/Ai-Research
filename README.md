# Resnet Implementation with Cifar-10 Dataset
Introductory assignment for the AI research lab of the University of Delaware, 
experimenting with computer vision model, Resnet-18. The training process tunes 
hyperparameters and validates model results with a cross entropy loss function. 

## Description
The 'Dive Into Deep Learning' library was used to simplify Cifar10 dataset and use
less compute. The 'demo' variable can be set to true to use the entire Cifar10 dataset.

## Installation
A couple of packages will need to be installed through pip or your favorite package manager:
- pytorch
- pandas
- d2l
- collections

## Usage
There are two ways to run this project,
1) Compile the Jupyter Notebook file 'dataOrganization.ipnyb' on a Jupyter
kernel, through AWS or the Anaconda Navigator
2) Compile 'dataOrganization.ipnyb' on a python version installed on your
local machine
